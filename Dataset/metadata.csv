class4_04| piece of wood what shall I do with it I think I will make it 
class4_05| a puppet he set to work and as the puppet boy took shape the
class4_06| old man said he must have a name I will call him pin pinochhi
class4_07|as soon as he finished the making the eyes the carpenter
class4_08| amazed to see them move before the mouth made it began to laugh
class4_09| stop laughing the old man said it did stop but as soon as he
class4_10| back was turned it put out its tongue and its nose longer
class4_11|no sooner were his hands ready then it snatched off the carpenter
class4_12| wig and put it on its on  head and then pino
class4_13|chhios's nose grw longer when its legs and feet were made
class4_14|they were too stiff to use so the carpenter showed pino
class4_15| chhio how to use them now the carpenter decided to send pinochhio
class4_16|school but there pinochhio did nothing but look for fun him often
class4_17| run away from school why don�t you go to school asked the carpenter pinochhio
class4_18| told him lie and his nose started growing longer and longer each time
class4_19| rude to someone or told lie his nose grew longer finally pino
class4_20|chhio said iam glad to be a real boy I will never lie again

class5_03| who went to school with him what he love to do most was to pinch he could make
class5_04|big bruise appear in half a second another trick he played was pricking people with a
class5_05| pin so you can guess how all the children hated him they tried pinching
class5_06| him back but that was no good because he could always pinch harder they
class5_07| didn't  tell they telling there teacher because that was
class5_08| telling tales its so happened that the class went for picnic to
class5_09|the seaside for whole day all the childrens were most excited on
